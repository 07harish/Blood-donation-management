    Registration
You will be required to fill up a health assessment questionnaire. Donors have to produce their identity cards or passport for registration.<br><br>		
Medical Screening 
A doctor or nurse will go through the questionnaire with you in detail. You need to sign a declaration form to confirm that the information you have given is true. Your blood pressure, weight and blood haemoglobin will also be checked. For first time donors, blood grouping will also be done.

Sit back and relax! A specially trained nurse will apply a localised painkiller to your arm before drawing blood. All equipment used is sterile, disposable and used only once to prevent spreading of diseases through blood donation. Giving blood is completely safe.	<br>	<br>	
Refreshments
After blood donation, light refreshments will be served to you while you take a short rest. The whole process, including the rest time, takes about 45 minutes.</p1></html>
