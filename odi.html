     <h1> Organ Donation in India </h1>
        <center>
    <p1>"Almost 1.5 lakh people in India need a kidney; however, only 3000 of them receive one.
Only 1 out of 30 people who need a kidney receive one.
90% of people in the waiting list die without getting an organ.
Indiaâ€™s annual liver transplant requirement is 25,000, but we manage only about 800.
70% liver transplants are taken care of by a live donor, but 30% are dependent on cadaver donations.

    <p2>Each year, hundreds of people die while waiting for an organ transplant. There is a shortage of organs, and the gap between the number of organs donated and the number of people waiting for a transplant is getting larger. Transplants, as an option, have successful outcomes, and the number of people needing a transplant is expected to rise steeply due to an ageing population and an increase in organ failure.</p2>
