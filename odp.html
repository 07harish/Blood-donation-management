    <p1>1-Organ Retrieval Banking Organisation (ORBO) coordinates the process of cadaver organ donation i.e.organ donation after death and transplantation.  
There are two ways to donate organs: -
By pledging for organ donation when a person is alive
By consent of family after death.
During lifetime, a person can pledge for organ donation by filling up a donor form in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom shall be a near relative.<br><br>

2-The organ donor form could be obtained from ORBO either personally or through mail.  It could also be downloaded from our Website (www.orbo.org).  <br><br>

3-The donor form is absolutely free of cost. <br>  <br>

4-As mentioned earlier, you need to fill up the donor form and get it signed by two witnesses one of whom shall be a near relative and send the same to ORBO.  <br><br>

5-After receiving the filled in form, ORBO provides the donor with an organ donor card bearing registration number on it.  <br><br>

6-It is suggested to keep the donor card in your pocket and share your decision with your near and dear ones. <br> <br>

7-If a person expires without registration, the family members can donate his/her organs.  For this they need to sign a consent form, which is provided at that time.  <br><br>

8-Once, the relatives give a written consent, organs are harvested within a few hours. <br><br>

9-The family of the donor does not face any difficulty or extra burden upon them.  <br><br>

10-The transplant coordination team carries out the entire process till the relatives receive the body of the deceased. <br> <br>

11-The deceased body is given back to the family in a dignified way.  <br><br>

12-There is no disfigurement.  The body can be viewed as in any case of death and funeral arrangements need not be delayed. <br><br>s
