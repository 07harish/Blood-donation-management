   In preparation for World Blood Donor Day on 14th June 2014, we want to determine if people give blood, common misconceptions around blood donation and barriers preventing people from facing the needle. Is it fear of the unknown or pure practicalities standing between us and a potential life-saving donation? .we are encouraging for blood donation 
<br>	<br>	
Each pint of donated blood can help three people in need of blood - thatâ€™s why we need your help to raise awareness. we also took survey that in karnatake, there is no active website like our project in the real-time. hence this project would help millions of people help save their lives<br>	<br>	

we took survey on bloodbanks and their identity is based on regiester id. hence in our project we differentiate bloodbanks using register id<br>	<br>	

Despite being a country with a population of 1.2 billion, India faces a blood shortage of 3 million units. The problem can be addressed if an additional two percent of Indians donated blood, health experts say.
According to a 2012 World Health Organisation (WHO) report, only nine million units are collected annually, while the need is for 12 million units.

India is still bothered by 1 omnipotent issue.Which is Anaemia at the time of child birth, pregnent women in most parts of the country still face this reality each day.Another issue which has came up since last few decades is Dengue and chikangunia.First one is giving all of us hard time especially in northern part of India.Last but not the least is Trauma and injury cases which happen anytime , anywhere. Please note that Death due to trauma injury is highest in India among the developing countries. Blood transfusion in such case is of the most importance.Blood donated during blood camps can save many lives each year at the cost of almost nothing.
<br>	<br>	
So , we all should donate blood at least once a year.
